Implementation of EM Algorithm for Image Segmentation for the AUF poster titled Parameter learning via EM algorithm, authors Claudiu Tîrîsî and Maria Anastasia Jivulescu.

The mml+theory.ipynb contains explanations regarding Gaussian Mixture Models and the EM algorithm, while mml.ipynb is a barebones implementation of GMM and EM without theory and explanations. 

em.py contains the classes and functions defined in the notebooks, and can be used in external projects.

The blobworld folder contains an implementation of the [Blobworld segmentation algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1023800) and the other feature extractors described in the poster.

The Blobworld implementation is heavily inspired by the original Matlab implementation (https://web.archive.org/web/20070712011639/http://dlp.cs.berkeley.edu/src/blobworld/segmentation_files.tar.gz)
